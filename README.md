# Duet - The Open-Source GTD Tasks App

Duet is a cross-platform app that will help you organize your life and tasks in a central place.

Offline-first, Duet is designed to allow you to have control over your data. All tasks, projects, and notes stay on your device, with none of it being stored on a cloud service somewhere.

Duet is based around the ideologies presented in Sir David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) methodology. There are some missing functionality still, but the idea is to add them in over the next few months.

## Features

Duet is still a work in progress. I have been working on a lot of versions of Duet since August of 2023, and have been using Duet almost daily since then to manage my work, as well as my personal life through it. You can expect to find rough edges, and features not added in yet; rest assured, I will be adding these soon enough over the next few months.

Here are the current list of features supported:

### Task Management

Basic task management functionality is currently supported.

- **Tasks**: You can add tasks with titles, descriptions, scheduled and due dates
- **Task Statuses**: Tasks can have a status of "Next", "Waiting", "Done", and "Cancelled", helping you keep track of the status of each task
- **Subtasks**: If a task is too complex, you can break it down through subtasks
- **Tags**: Organize tasks through tags for more easily managing your task list

### Projects

Break down more complex tasks into projects. Projects will show you a list of all tasks that belong to it, along with project support material as per the GTD recommendation.

### Notes

Add individual notes, or project support material. Notes has a fully featured markdown editor (as do tasks descriptions, and project descriptions actually!), and it will extended with better usability with a toolbar for common actions in future updates.

Notes are currently a recent feature added, and while basic functionality works without issues, there are UX improvements, as well as better notes organization that will be added in future updates.

## Get Duet

Duet is currently released as an Android app, which you can get through the Releases page on Github. You can also point Obtanium to this repository for better managing updates to the app. I am currently looking into the possibility of releasing this on F-Droid as well.

Duet can also be packaged as a PWA. I will add instructions for this soon.

Duet will also be packaged for iOS and desktop - macOS, Linux (mostly Flatpak) and Windows. I would firstly like to get basic functionality working on Android before I package it for more platforms.
